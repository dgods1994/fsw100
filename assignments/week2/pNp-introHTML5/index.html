            <p>When I started this course, I had no experience with HTML whatsoever. I am amazed, having taken online courses in the past, at how very well the courses here at Bryan are put together. The learning tools are amazing! I have never felt so confident in anything after such a short time! I haven't even been in this class a week and I feel as if I could already do this for a living! Very, very pleased so far!</p>
